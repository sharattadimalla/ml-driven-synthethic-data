# ML Driven Synthetic Data Generation

Data is complex, relational and more often the profile of it constantly varies. Traditional approaches of rule based test data generation cannot evolve and scale to meet the need of high quality synthetic data

## Problem Statement

1. **Use Case 1** : Automated Software application testing in non-prod environments
2. **Use Case 2** : Performance testing of software applications in perf enironment
3. **Use Case 3** : Logic Validation by Analytical Users in non-prod environments
4. **Use Case 4** : ML training for limited labeled data

## Solution - ML Driven Synthetic Data Generation

## Benefits

1. Deep Learning Neural Networks accurately capture the column statistical distributions along with custom constraints to generate high quality synthetic data
2. Small - Large volumes of high quality synthetic data can be generated
